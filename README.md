# FlyBook

## Overview of Application
As a Colorado native and an avid outdoorsman, it goes without saying I love to fly fish! That's where the inspiration for this application comes from. I started tying my own flies a few years ago...

This is a fly tying application. The main purpose for the app is to allow users to track the flies they have tied along with the recipe for that particular fly. It also allows the user to add flies and recipes they would like to tie in the future.
